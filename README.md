# Illegal Dice Game

GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
- In each turn, a player rolls a die as many times as they wish.  Each result gets added to their ROUND score.
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, their ROUND score is reset to zero and it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that their ROUND score gets added to their GLOBAL score.  After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach 100 points in their GLOBAL score wins the game.

NEW SKILLS LEARNED:

- Ternary operators.
- State variables.
