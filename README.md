# Illegal Dice Game

GAME RULES:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
- In each turn, a player rolls a die as many times as they wish.  Each result gets added to their ROUND score.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that their ROUND score gets added to their GLOBAL score.  After that, it's the next player's turn.
- BUT...
⋅⋅- If the player rolls a 1, their ROUND score is reset to zero and it's the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach 100 points in their GLOBAL score wins the game.

NEW CODING SKILLS LEARNED:

- Ternary operators.
- State variables.
- querySelectors.

FUTURE ITERATIONS:

- Add link to my portfolio.
- Add link to my GitHub.
- Add favicon.
- Debug: Three logos are showing up on my local machine but not on Heroku.
- If a player rolls two sixes in a row, both their global score and current score are reset to zero. It is then the next player's turn. (Always save the previous dice roll in a separate variable.)
- Add an input field to the HTML where players can set the winning score. (Look up .value property in JavaScript.)
- Make the game have TWO dice. The player's current score is set to zero if either of the dice rolls a 1. (Use HTML and CSS to position the two dice.)
